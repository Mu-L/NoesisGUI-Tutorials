[ImageBrush](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._ImageBrush.html) can be extended by using pixel shaders. By deriving from the abstract [BrushShader](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._BrushShader.html) class, you can generate procedural pattern brushes driven by a pixel shader. This is more efficient than a [ShaderEffect](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core._ShaderEffect.html) because offscreen usage is not needed. Find more information about custom shader in the [Shader Tutorial](https://www.noesisengine.com/docs/Gui.Core.ShadersTutorial.html).
